# Group Hub

A small full-stack app for a group with member accounts, roles, and an admin dashboard.

## Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18 + Vite + react-router
- **Backend:** Node + Express, SQLite (better-sqlite3)
- **Auth:** username + password (bcrypt-hashed), JWT sessions

## Features
- Admin creates member accounts (username + password + role)
- Members sign in with their credentials and see the member directory
- Member directory: members see each other's profiles
- Admin dashboard: create members, promote/demote roles, remove members
- Profile editing (display name, bio)

## Run it

Two terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1: backend on http://localhost:4000
cd server
npm install
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: frontend on http://localhost:5173
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

A default admin account is seeded on first run:
- username: `admin`
- password: `admin123`

Change the password by editing your profile, or set `JWT_SECRET` and `PORT` in a `server/.env`.

## Roles
- `member` – can view directory, edit own profile
- `admin` – everything above plus the admin dashboard (create members, manage roles, remove)

## Data
Data is stored in `server/group.db` (SQLite). Delete the file to reset.
